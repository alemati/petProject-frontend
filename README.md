# Pet project frontend  
[Heroku demo](https://glacial-bayou-33164.herokuapp.com/)  
[Backend](https://github.com/alemati/petProject-backend)

This project is an attempt to create fullstack application using [**M**angoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2) [**E**xpress](https://expressjs.com/) [**R**eact](https://reactjs.org/) [**N**odeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) stack. Goal of this project is to get some practice with web development and to learn more about fullstack by making my own mistakes and fixing them. [Project requirements](https://web-palvelinohjelmointi-20.mooc.fi/projekti) were taken from uni course that I participated in during my stidies. With this project I wanted to write software that is not far away from potential real life case and solve problems that would roughly emulate the web development process on actual working place.  

This version is far from being completely ready and I am intending to keep the code and Heroku demo updated upon acquiring more knowledge about technologies, tools, development practises etc. So far this project was very usefull and educational. During this project I already came across some nuances that gave me more knowledge/experience and as I will add more complicated features I will discover more aspects to learn from.

As I mentioned before I see many ways to improve this project. Some of them are: user search feature, adding profile picture, 'settings' page (info change), better disign and layout, error handling and improved notifications,, refactoring and organasing project/forder structure better, testing. I am planning to implement those features and fixes in future.

If you have some project related opinion or an advice, I will be happy to hear it or read it!
